## What is a Stack?
- Stack: An abstract data type with the following operations:
- Push(key): Adds key to collection
- Key Top(): returns most recently-added key
- Key Pop(): removes and returns most recently-added key
- Boolean Empty(): are there any elements?

## Summary
- Stacks can be implemented with either an array or a linked list.
- Each stack operation is O(1): Push, Pop, Top, Empty.
- Stacks are occasionally known as LIFO queues.
